How Computers are used in Space

	The decades of the 1960’s and 1970’s saw great advancement in the fields of both computing and Space exploration.  It was not long before the need to bring computing power into space arose in order to better conduct experiments and process results.  It was not long before the realization was made that conventional computers can give inaccurate data due to solar and cosmic radiation.  This happens when a particle of radiation connects with a transistor inside an integrated circuit, inadvertently telling it to change a bits output from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0(this phenomenon is known as a “single event upset” or SEU).  The first widely accepted solution was to introduce a process called radiation hardening on circuits so that they are able to withstand SEU’s while still creating accurate data.  Radiation hardened circuits have proven to be a very useful tool for government and private space exploration organizations, they are created using a very expensive process and consume a great deal of power in order to run and have a very low processing speed.
	As Space exploration and scientific experiments in space becomes more sophisticated, the need for increased computing power is quickly becoming a top priority for organizations who send devices and people into Space.  In 2005, NASA announced that they were working on a project called environmental adaptive fault tolerant computing (EAFTC) this project had intended to use several commercial off the shelf (COTS) circuits with added redundant steps to ensure data accuracy.  This is done by taking constant readings from a radiation detector that is attached to the circuits, deciding whether results calculated by these circuits will be accurate, then using several CPU’s to run the same calculation, they then vote on the result. 
	In 2012, SpaceX’ Dragon spacecraft began using a similar system to this using COTS processors to run unmanned supply missions to the International Space Station (ISS), it was reported to have had several anomalies occur during the flight.  This has prompted the developers of this technology to redesign several elements in the system.
	In 2013, a new design idea was introduced by a team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University called a High Performance Fault Tolerant System (HPFTS).  This system will have the ability to use both the redundancy described in this paper as well as traditional parallel processing.  This system will involve the use of a control unit, which will constantly scan for and reset any faulty processors while deciding which processing units are capable of reliably conducting calculations, there are also processing units, these are high performance devices consisting of COTS that will handle signal processing and perform calculations.  The system will also have logic components known as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), this will control a crafts position and environmental conditions, as well as deciding the importance of specific on-board operations, deciding what level of redundancy or parallel processing is used.
	HPFTS is a good system in theory, however there are many recorded incidents that have shown that spacecraft can be hit by large amounts of solar radiation, which could possibly render every COTS component on board to be too unreliable to conduct any processing.  The chosen paper for this project (A High Performance DSP System with Fault Tolerant for Space Missions) also makes no mention of exactly how much redundancy this system will require, so one would believe that implementation of this system could create a great deal of complications in the form of power consumption and processing speed due to the extreme levels of redundancy.  Therefore it is entirely possible that this system will not save on power consumption or provide any additional processing speed.  The paper also makes no mention of how many lines of code will be required to have all of the computing systems on a spacecraft operational.  The paper does include a section showing optimistic results, however only results are provided for systems with either no faults or only one fault in the system while mentioning that having more than one fault in the system drastically reduces the signal processing power due to a system pause followed by a restart from the beginning of the operation.  While being able to tolerate a single fault in the system, the inability to account for multiple faults is a major detriment to this systems practicality as an extended significant blast of radiation would cause the crafts computing systems to malfunction for a long period of time.

	Traditional Radiation Hardened Components	Redundant Commercial components
Reliability	Good	Good most of the time
Cost	High	Lower
Power Consumption	High	Lower
Processing Speed	Low	Higher
Implementation	Simple	Complicated

	The implementation of Environmentally Adaptive Fault Tolerant Computing (EAFTC) has been under development by NASA and their associate organizations since 2005 and while they are being used by critical systems on unmanned craft such as the Dragon from SpaceX, multiple errors show that this type of computing still needs a great deal of refinement before it should be trusted with manned missions. 
	The concept of an HPFTS system in spacecraft theoretically is a good idea, however the use of components that are known to be unreliable in the given environment would lead one to believe that the beginning of the use of this technology could lead to dangerous situations involving not only the crew of a Spacecraft or Space Station but also a large investment from the government or agency that sponsors the mission.  Some believe that having the ability for high-speed, reliable computing in space missions can be created by using new theoretical computing methods that do not involve silicon transistors.  The need for higher computing power remains an immediate obstacle for space missions who seek to do more experimentation and data processing.
